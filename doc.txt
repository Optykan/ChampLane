Weighting (w), higher = better confidence:

SPELLS
10w -> smite (jungle)
2w -> tp (top)
2w -> ignite (mid)
2w -> barrier (mid)
3w -> exhaust (support)
3w -> heal (marksman)

PRIMARY ROLES AND COMBOS

TOP
+3w -> "tank (primary)"
+3w -> "tank/fighter" & no smite

JUNGLE
+10w -> only smite

MID
+4w -> "mage (primary)"
+1w -> "mage (only)"
+6w -> "mage (primary)" & ignite

+3w -> "assassin/fighter"
+3w -> "assassin (primary)"
+4w -> "assassin (primary)" & ignite
+5w -> "assassin/fighter" & ignite
+6w -> "assassin/mage" & ignite

+4w -> "support (primary)"
+6w -> "support (primary)" & exhaust
+3w -> "support (secondary)" & exhaust

MARKSMAN
+3w -> "marksman (primary)"



CONSIDER REVISING TOWARDS A 5 POINT BASED SYSTEM
EACH TYPE IN A CATEGORY INCREASE THAT ROLES CHANCE
so:
champ x = [0, 1, 3, 8, 0] would be most likely support
